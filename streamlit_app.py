# Welcome to the NCC Parcel Search!

Welcome Forward Real Estate Team! 👋 
 This is the automation tool for parcel search of New Castle County ***ONLY***. 
Right now you can only search one parcel at at time 😭. 
But I'm working on getting you able to search multiple at a time. 
So far I focused on getting you this tool available so that you can start using it right away from your own computers. 
I'll communicate updates to this tool as they come. **Let's work!** 🚀

In the meantime, below is an example of what you can do with just a few lines of code:
"""

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.common.exceptions import TimeoutException
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from webdriver_manager.firefox import GeckoDriverManager

URL = "http://www.python.org"
TIMEOUT = 20

st.title("Test Selenium")

firefoxOptions = Options()
firefoxOptions.add_argument("--headless")
service = Service(GeckoDriverManager().install())
driver = webdriver.Firefox(
    options=firefoxOptions,
    service=service,
)
driver.get(URL)
st.write(driver.title)




# with st.echo(code_location='below'):
#     total_points = st.slider("Number of points in spiral", 1, 5000, 2000)
#     num_turns = st.slider("Number of turns in spiral", 1, 100, 9)

#     Point = namedtuple('Point', 'x y')
#     data = []

#     points_per_turn = total_points / num_turns

#     for curr_point_num in range(total_points):
#         curr_turn, i = divmod(curr_point_num, points_per_turn)
#         angle = (curr_turn + 1) * 2 * math.pi * i / points_per_turn
#         radius = curr_point_num / total_points
#         x = radius * math.cos(angle)
#         y = radius * math.sin(angle)
#         data.append(Point(x, y))

#     st.altair_chart(alt.Chart(pd.DataFrame(data), height=500, width=500)
#         .mark_circle(color='#0068c9', opacity=0.5)
#         .encode(x='x:Q', y='y:Q'))
